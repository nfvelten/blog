# 🌴 Life beyond the keyboard

## **In My Personal Life**

I'm happily married and share life's ups and downs with my wonderful partner. Together, we create a world filled with laughter, love, and unforgettable moments.

Our home is a lively place thanks to three adorable cats. Each one has a unique personality and keeps us entertained with their playful antics. 🐱🐱🐱

## **My Personal Interests**

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring some of my favorite passions:

**Music Lover:** I can't get enough of music – it's my daily dose of inspiration. Whether I'm discovering new tracks or enjoying live performances, music keeps my spirits high.

**Comics Enthusiast:** Comics are my escape into captivating worlds. I love getting lost in their stories, and they never fail to spark my imagination.

**Football Fan:** Sports, especially football, are a big deal for me. There's nothing quite like the thrill of cheering for my favorite team on game day.

**Health and Wellness:** I believe in staying fit and healthy, which is why I'm a regular at the gym. It's not just about exercise; it's a commitment to maintaining a vibrant and active lifestyle.

**Caffeine Aficionado:** To kickstart my day and keep my creative juices flowing, I savor the rich flavors of both Yerba Mate and coffee. They're my secret weapons for powering through the day.

Beyond the technical world, these interests and experiences shape who I am. I'm all about growth, embracing new challenges, and making the most of every moment.
