# üíª The tech side

## Full-Stack Proficiency

Throughout my career, I've cultivated a versatile skill set covering both back-end and front-end technologies:

* **Back-End:** My proficiency in Node.js extends to building scalable APIs and implementing microservices architectures. I've also worked extensively with databases, including both relational and NoSQL solutions.
* **Front-End:** I'm skilled in creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. My experience includes optimizing web applications for performance and accessibility.

### Cloud Experience

I've ventured into cloud computing and infrastructure as code, leveraging AWS, GCP, Docker, and Kubernetes. This expertise has enabled me to design, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications with a focus on scalability and security.

### CI/CD Implementation

My projects have featured streamlined development workflows through the implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. These pipelines automate testing, deployment, and code quality checks, ensuring a robust and efficient development process.

### Architectural Best Practices

I'm dedicated to adhering to industry best practices for software architecture:

* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** I prioritize comprehensive test coverage, ensuring that code is reliable and maintainable.
* **Clean Code:** My codebase reflects clean code principles, fostering collaboration and making maintenance a breeze.
* **Hexagonal Architecture:** Leveraging this architectural style, I've built modular, testable software that remains adaptable to evolving requirements.

## Project Management üìä

In addition to my technical skills, I've successfully applied Agile methodologies like SCRUM and Kanban for efficient project management. My experience working with distributed teams has sharpened my communication skills, allowing for seamless collaboration and on-time project deliveries.

## Collaboration and Leadership ü§ù

I'm an effective communicator and a collaborative team member. I've taken on leadership roles, guiding projects and supporting the growth of fellow developers. My ability to foster a collaborative environment has consistently contributed to the success of our projects.

## The Path Ahead üåê

My journey in the tech world is a perpetual quest for growth and innovation. I'm always on the lookout for fresh challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible in software development. Lifelong learning and creative problem-solving are at the core of my approach.
